# Visual Sorting Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project visualizes five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The visualization uses vertical bars of varying heights to represent array values, illustrating the sorting process in real-time. All algorithms run simultaneously on different number arrays, and the time taken for each algorithm is displayed upon completion.

## Features

- Simultaneous Visualization: Visualizes five sorting algorithms at once.
- Dynamic Bar Representation: Bars reflect array values by height.
- Performance Measurement: Displays sorting duration for each algorithm.
- User Interaction: Sorting initiated by button click.
